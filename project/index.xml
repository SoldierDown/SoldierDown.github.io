      <title>Sparse Representation of Symmetric Positive Definite Matrices with Application in Texture Classification</title>

      <description>Encoding image information as Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices has become a popular method in computer vision and image analysis. However, it has been two challenges to analyze and process data of this type since (1) SPD matrices lie in a convex cone; (2) SPD matrices do not obey Euclidean geometry, but rather lie on the manifold with a Riemannian metric. This paper tackles the problem of sparse coding and dictionary learning in the space of SPD matrices.</description>

      <description>In this project, we aim to implement and compare different machine learning algorithms adopted to the multiple-instance learning (MIL) setting in image scene classification tasks. We also present a novel hierarchical learning framework for feature extraction. We first utilized the bag-of-words model to present each image as a bag of its visual words. Then we built and test several classifiers on the histogram of the word maps as baseline methods, including Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier, and artificial neural network (ANN).</description>

      <title>Analysis of intermediate layers in Regional-based Convolution Neural Networks by Classifier Probes</title>

      <description>Convolutional neural networks, or CNNs, has been widely applied to various facial related problems, including facial land-marking, individual face matching, and 3D facial reconstruction. Despite its success in robust face detection in terms of performance, there are still some challenges raised by strong illumination, sizes of faces and artifacts. Particularly, in CNN training, the feature extraction and detection results are greatly affected by the structure of the network. Hence, it is desirable to be able to perform some kind of analysis on convolution neural nets, such as feature map visualization at different stages, which helps design of network structure and tuning of hyper-parameters and thus improves feature extraction as well as classification accuracy.</description>

      <description>A method of using multiple uniform distributed ultrasonic sensors to collect spatial data and model geometrical characteristic of the environment with partial information is introduced. Improving traditional method of approximation based on inefficient data. Detecting real-time objectsâ€™ movement including position, direction and velocity within 3m. Using FPGA to control time-divided detecting among groups so that interference between sensors are mostly reduced, and send real-time environment information to host computer with serial interface.</description>

      <title>On an integral form for calculating induced electric field</title>
      <link>https://SoldierDown.github.io/project/electric-field/</link>

      <guid>https://SoldierDown.github.io/project/electric-field/</guid>
      <description>In this paper, the integral expression for calculating the induced electric field is given by analogy to the Biot-Savart Law. The expression is proved by Helmholtz theorem and Maxwell equations. Based on the method, the paper discussed the distribution of the induced electric field generated by magnetic field in square, triangle and arbitrary polygon area.
