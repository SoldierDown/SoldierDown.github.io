 GUI and CLI interface A simple implementation of AI player Play remotely through socket interface   How to use Simply run:
$ python gomoku.py  or a CLI version (pretty much forked from Skywind):
$ python gomoku_cli.py  and enjoy!
Game control and settings Change player types in gomoku.py:
PLTYP1 = &#39;human&#39; PLTYP2 = &#39;computer&#39;  Music and sound effect:
play_music = True play_sound = True  Acknowledgement AI code adopted from here by Skywind.</description>

      <title>Tools for Axis Label Alignment in MATLAB</title>
      <link>https://SoldierDown.github.io/post/matlab-axis-align/</link>

This is a simple MATLAB function for axis label alignment. If you have ever struggled with the label alignment issue in MATLAB&amp;rsquo;s 3-D plots &amp;mdash; by default axis labels are placed horizontally no matter how you rotate the plot &amp;mdash; here is a simple fix.
It still works when Projection mode is Perspective or when DataAspectRatio is not [1 1 1].</description>

      <description>A method of using multiple uniform distributed ultrasonic sensors to collect spatial data and model geometrical characteristic of the environment with partial information is introduced. Improving traditional method of approximation based on inefficient data. Detecting real-time objectsâ€™ movement including position, direction and velocity within 3m. Using FPGA to control time-divided detecting among groups so that interference between sensors are mostly reduced, and send real-time environment information to host computer with serial interface.</description>

      <title>On an integral form for calculating induced electric field</title>
      <link>https://SoldierDown.github.io/project/electric-field/</link>

      <description>In this paper, the integral expression for calculating the induced electric field is given by analogy to the Biot-Savart Law. The expression is proved by Helmholtz theorem and Maxwell equations. Based on the method, the paper discussed the distribution of the induced electric field generated by magnetic field in square, triangle and arbitrary polygon area.
