      <description>Encoding image information as Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices has become a popular method in computer vision and image analysis. However, it has been two challenges to analyze and process data of this type since (1) SPD matrices lie in a convex cone; (2) SPD matrices do not obey Euclidean geometry, but rather lie on the manifold with a Riemannian metric. This paper tackles the problem of sparse coding and dictionary learning in the space of SPD matrices.</description>

      <title>Multiple-Instance Learning in Scene Classification</title>

      <description>In this project, we aim to implement and compare different machine learning algorithms adopted to the multiple-instance learning (MIL) setting in image scene classification tasks. We also present a novel hierarchical learning framework for feature extraction. We first utilized the bag-of-words model to present each image as a bag of its visual words. Then we built and test several classifiers on the histogram of the word maps as baseline methods, including Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier, and artificial neural network (ANN).</description>
