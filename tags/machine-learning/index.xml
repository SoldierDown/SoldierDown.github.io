      <title>Sparse Representation of Symmetric Positive Definite Matrices with Application in Texture Classification</title>

      <description>Encoding image information as Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices has become a popular method in computer vision and image analysis. However, it has been two challenges to analyze and process data of this type since (1) SPD matrices lie in a convex cone; (2) SPD matrices do not obey Euclidean geometry, but rather lie on the manifold with a Riemannian metric. This paper tackles the problem of sparse coding and dictionary learning in the space of SPD matrices.</description>

      <title>Multiple-Instance Learning in Scene Classification</title>

      <description>In this project, we aim to implement and compare different machine learning algorithms adopted to the multiple-instance learning (MIL) setting in image scene classification tasks. We also present a novel hierarchical learning framework for feature extraction. We first utilized the bag-of-words model to present each image as a bag of its visual words. Then we built and test several classifiers on the histogram of the word maps as baseline methods, including Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier, and artificial neural network (ANN).</description>

      <title>Analysis of intermediate layers in Regional-based Convolution Neural Networks by Classifier Probes</title>
      <link>https://SoldierDown.github.io/project/classifier-probe/</link>

      <description>Convolutional neural networks, or CNNs, has been widely applied to various facial related problems, including facial land-marking, individual face matching, and 3D facial reconstruction. Despite its success in robust face detection in terms of performance, there are still some challenges raised by strong illumination, sizes of faces and artifacts. Particularly, in CNN training, the feature extraction and detection results are greatly affected by the structure of the network. Hence, it is desirable to be able to perform some kind of analysis on convolution neural nets, such as feature map visualization at different stages, which helps design of network structure and tuning of hyper-parameters and thus improves feature extraction as well as classification accuracy.</description>
