      <description>Checkout the code on File Exchange or Github
There are two main methods for tomographic reconstruction: 1. Filtered back-projection or FBP which is based on Radon transform and its inverse transform; 2. Algebraic reconstruction technique or ART which is based on solving linear algebra equations.
The MATLAB code contains functions for both FBPs and ARTs (the built-in lsqr solver is recommended):
 tomo_projection_2d, computes projections of a given image; build_weight_matrix, builds weighting factor matrix used for algebraic methods; tomo_reconstruction_bp, reconstructs the image from its projections using BP method; tomo_reconstruction_fbp, reconstructs the image from its projections using FBP method; tomo_reconstruction_art, reconstructs the image from its projections using ART method; tomo_reconstruction_sart, reconstructs the image from its projections using SART method; tomo_reconstruction_lsqr, reconstructs the image from its projections, using the build-in lsqr solver.</description>
